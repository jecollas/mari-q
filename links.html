  <p><a class="active" href="https://jecollas.github.io/mythgen/" target="_blank" title="Myth Generators"><b>Myth Generators</b></a> is a collection of plot generators that I made for the plot team at <a href="https://www.mythlarp.com/" target="_blank" title="Myth LARP">Myth LARP</a>.

  <p><a class="active" href="https://jecollas.github.io/volmoon/" target="_blank" title="Volmoon"><b>Volmoon</b></a> is my senior thesis. It is a data-driven interactive historical horror fiction game about the disturbing events of Bedburg, Germany in the fall of 1589. It uses original writing, illustration, and computer code to build an atmosphere of dread and tell this story how I believe it should be told. Created with Clip Studio Paint, inklewriter, HTML5, CSS, and Jekyll.</p>

  <p><a class="active" href="https://jecollas.github.io/singleserve/" target="_blank" title="Charendo's Book of Heroes"><b>Charendo's Book of Heroes</b></a> is a random generator that I made in my sophomore year of college for a programming class project. The purpose of this generator is to create a new Player Character for the tabletop roleplaying game, Dungeons and Dragons. Features of this generator include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An accurate stat portrayal that organizes a character's with the class selection in mind (example: a bard would have Charisma as their highest stat).</li>
    <li>A complete listing of all deities, races, subraces, classes, and backgrounds in the D&D 5e Player's Handbook and all other official Wizard's of the Coast material.</li>
    <li>Multiple gender options that allow for the random character to be trans, nonbinary, or intersex.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><a class="active" href="https://jecollas.github.io/ariel-joy/" target="_blank" title="Ariel Joy"><b>Ariel Joy</b></a> is a random generator that I created for a friend of mine in an attempt to spread a little bit more love and positivity.</p>

  <p><a class="active" href="https://jecollas.github.io/serverartgen/" target="_blank" title="Marvelverse"><b>Marvelverse</b></a> was made with my friends in mind. Art block is a common problem amongst them, so I wanted to build a series of random generators that would supply them with ideas about what to draw. Web design by myself, side logo and banner design by <a href="mailto: kthornton157@gmail.com" title="Katie Thornton">Katie Thornton</a>. This site includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Four random generators for art and writing prompts.</li>
    <li>Character reference pages for all major characters.</li>
    <li>A gallery for art dedicated to characters in the server.</li>
    <li>A gallery for art dedicated to characters in the D&D campaign currently run by members of the server.</li>
  </ul>
