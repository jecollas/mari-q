  <p><a class="active" href="https://jecollas.github.io/singleserve/" target="_blank">Random D&D Character Generator:</a> This is a random generator that I made in my sophomore year of college for a programming class project. The purpose of this generator is to create a new Player Character for the tabletop roleplaying game, Dungeons and Dragons. Features of this generator include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An accurate stat portrayal that organizes a character's with the class selection in mind (example: a bard would have Charisma as their highest stat).</li>
    <li>A complete listing of all deities, races, subraces, classes, and backgrounds in the D&D 5e Player's Handbook and all other official Wizard's of the Coast material.</li>
    <li>Multiple gender options that allow for the random character to be trans, nonbinary, or intersex.</li>
  </ul>

This is another class project from sophomore year that focused on themes and layouts. All images and information in this website have been taken directly from their wikipedia pages.</p>
