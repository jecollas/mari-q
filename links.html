      <p><a class="active" href="https://jecollas.github.io/singleserve/" target="_blank">Random D&D Character Generator:</a> This is a random generator that I made in my sophomore year of college for a programming class project. The purpose of this generator is to create a new Player Character for the tabletop roleplaying game, Dungeons and Dragons.<br>
      Features of this Generator Include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An accurate stat portrayal that factors in bonuses from race selection and organizes them with the class selection in mind</li>
        <ul>
          <li>(If the character created is a Halfling Bard, that character would have a bonus +2 to Dexterity and would have Charisma as their highest stat)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>A complete listing of all deities, races, subraces, classes, and backgrounds in the D&D 5e Player's Handbook</li>
        <li>Nonbinary gender option</li>
      </ul>

      <p><a class="active" href="https://jecollas.github.io/serverartgen/" target="_blank">Marvelverse Art Inspiration:</a> Art block is a common problem amongst my group of friends, so I wanted to build a series of random generators that would supply them with ideas of what to draw.

        <ul>
