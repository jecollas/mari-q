      <p><a class="active" href="https://jecollas.github.io/singleserve/" target="_blank">Random D&D Character Generator:</a> This is a random generator that I made in my sophomore year of college for a programming class project. The purpose of this generator is to create a new Player Character for the tabletop roleplaying game, Dungeons and Dragons. Features of this Generator Include:<br>
      An accurate stat portrayal that factors in bonuses from race selection and organizes them with the class selection in mind. Aka, if the character created is a Halfling Bard, that character would have a bonus +2 to Dexterity and would have Charisma as their highest stat.</p>
